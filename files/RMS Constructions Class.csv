Code,NAME,DESCRIPTION,
RMS:0,Unknown,"Unknown : Use if the construction class is unknown. When specified, the model uses appropriate region- dependent building inventory to construct a composite vulnerability curve that is representative of the average vulnerability over all construction classes associated with the buildings occupancy type, year of construction, number of stories and floor area, if specified.",
RMS:1,Wood,"Wood : Buildings in which the perimeter wall and roof construction consists of wood framing. Walls are typically wood studs sheathed on exposed exterior surfaces with plywood, lap siding, stucco, or brick veneer and on interior surfaces with gypsum board or lath and plaster. Floors and roofs are typically constructed of wood joists sheathed with plywood or wood decking.",
RMS:1A,Light Wood Frame,Light Wood Frame,
RMS:1A1,Light Wood Stud Walls,"Light Wood Stud Walls : Buildings with walls constructed of 2x4 or 2x6 wood studs spaced at 16 covered on the outside with plywood, lap siding, or stucco and on the inside with gypsum board or lath and plaster. Floors are constructed of 2x8 - 2x12 wood joists covered with plywood, and roofs are constructed of 2x6 joists covered by plywood or spaced boards and shingles. Gravity loads are carried by the walls in shear and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This is a very common form of residential construction throughout the U.S. Well constructed buildings of this type are typically earthquake resistant because of the high lateral force strength that the wood stud walls with plywood provides, and because the buildings are light weight. either lattice bamboo covered with mud (known as shinkabe) or wood lath with plaster (ohkabe). Many severe earthquakes in Japan in the 20th century have demonstrated that these buildings, constructed prior to about 1980, are not earthquake resistant. Gravity loads are carried by the posts, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This type of construction is not common in the U.S.",
RMS:1A3,Light Wood Stud Walls with Brick Masonry Veneer,"Light Wood Stud Walls with Brick Masonry Veneer : Buildings in which the exterior façade consists of a Brick Masonry Veneer anchored with brick ties to a Light Wood Stud Framework. The interior is finished with plasterboard. Gravity loads are carried by the stud walls in compression, which are also braced with metal straps, wood, or structural plywood to support lateral loads. Increased weight of the brick veneer and out-of-plane failures contribute to a decrease in seismic performance relative to 1A1.",
RMS:1B,Heavy Timber,Heavy Timber,
RMS:1B1,Heavy Timber Frame,"Heavy Timber Frame : Buildings constructed with large vertical members (posts or columns), typically 8x8 or larger, that are capable of supporting heavy industrial or warehouse loads and with large horizontal members that are capable of supporting heavy loads over long spans. Gravity forces are carried by the posts or columns, and lateral earthquake forces are typically resisted either by shear in walls or by knee-wall bracing (partial height diagonal bracing). Pole construction, in which large poles are installed in holes drilled into the ground and extend to the desired one-, two-, or three- story building height, is one form of heavy timber construction. In pole construction, lateral earthquake resistance is established from the embedment of the pole into the ground.",
RMS:1B2,Heavy Timber Frame with Unreinforced Masonry Infill,"Heavy Timber Frame with Unreinforced Masonry Infill : Buildings with large vertical and horizontal members, similar in size to those in Construction Class 1B1, but with masonry infill providing the lateral earthquake force resistance. This type of construction is very popular in the U.S. for schools, gymnasiums, and churches, in which the large beams and columns are commonly gluelam (thin, approx. 1 boards, that are glued together to form a beam with a depth of about 24).",
RMS:2,Masonry,Masonry,
RMS:2A,Weak Masonry,Weak Masonry,
RMS:2A1,Rubble Stone Masonry,"Rubble Stone Masonry : Buildings having walls constructed using uncut stone masonry units, and likely using a weak mortar. Floors typically have wood joists covered with boards. The roof is also made up with wood joists, and covered with a water shedding material. Older buildings may have a heavy earthen material roof, while newer buildings of this type may have light corrugated metal sheeting. Weak mortar is material that is not stable in water, as opposed to Portland Cement mortar which is stable in water. Thus, while the stone masonry units will retain their strength over time, the strength of the mortar will degrade over time. Gravity loads are carried by the walls in compression, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. Although this type of construction is still being used throughout the world, it has not been very common since the beginning of the 20th Century.",
RMS:2A2,Adobe,"Adobe : Buildings having walls constructed of adobe masonry units and likely using a weak mortar. Floors are typically wood joists covered with boards. The roof is also made up with wood joists, and covered with a water shedding material. Older buildings may have a heavy earthen material roof, while newer buildings of this type are likely to have heavy clay tile. Adobe unit masonry blocks are typically sun dried, therefore they are not stable in water. Thus, both the adobe blocks and the mortar are subject to strength deterioration with time. Gravity loads are resisted by the walls in compression, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This type of construction was very popular in the southwest U.S. and in many other countries throughout the world in the 19th century, but it is presently found only rarely in the U.S. and in rural parts of Central and South America.",
RMS:2A3,Reinforced Adobe,"Reinforced Adobe : Adobe construction reinforced by steel mesh, steel bars or bamboos.",
RMS:2B,Unreinforced Masonry,Unreinforced Masonry,
RMS:2B1,Unreinforced Cut Stone Masonry,"Unreinforced Cut Stone Masonry : Buildings having walls constructed of cut stone masonry units stacked together with mortar. Floors are typically wood joists covered with boards. The roof is also made up with wood joists, and covered with a water shedding material. Older buildings may have a heavy earthen material roof, while newer buildings of this type are likely to have heavy clay tile. This type of construction was common for large institutional buildings in the 19th century and early 20th century, and usually has a large footprint. Gravity loads are carried by the walls in compression, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This type of construction is still used today throughout the world, but mostly only for its esthetic value. The mortar in older buildings is likely to be weak (non- Portland Cement type) while newer buildings are likely to be constructed using strong and durable Portland Cement mortar.",
RMS:2B2,Unreinforced Solid Brick Masonry,"Unreinforced Solid Brick Masonry : Buildings having walls constructed of solid brick masonry units stacked together with mortar. Floors are typically wood joists covered with boards or plywood sheeting. The roof is also made up with wood joists, and covered with a water shedding material. Roof surface covering for this type of building includes a variety of materials such as wood shingles, asbestos shingles, and clay tile. Gravity loads are carried by the walls in compression, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This is, and for several centuries has been, a very common form of construction for all types of occupancies worldwide. Earthquake astute parts of the world, however, have abandoned this type of construction. For example, unreinforced masonry construction has not been permitted in California since about 1940.",
RMS:2B3,Unreinforced Concrete Block Masonry,"Unreinforced Concrete Block Masonry : Buildings having the same characteristics as those for Construction Class 2B2 except that the masonry units are concrete block. Because concrete block has been in use only since about the 1920s, buildings of this type are likely to be newer than brick buildings. This is a very common form of construction in the U.S., and is also seen in many countries throughout the world.",
RMS:2B4,Unreinforced Brick Cavity,Unreinforced Brick Cavity : Used only for modeling earthquake in Australia and New Zealand ,

RMS:2C,Structural Masonry,Structural Masonry,
RMS:2C1,Reinforced Masonry,"Reinforced Masonry : Buildings having walls constructed of masonry units stacked together with mortar, and include steel reinforcing. A variety of masonry units are used for constructing buildings of this type such as solid brick, hollow clay tile, concrete block and cut stone. Hollow masonry units are reinforced by inserting reinforcing steel in the cells and then filling the cells with grout. Solid masonry units are reinforced by creating a sandwich having masonry units on the outer and inner surface, with a reinforced concrete layer between them. Floors are typically wood joists covered with boards or plywood sheeting. The roof is made up with wood joists, and covered with a water shedding material. Roof surface coverings for this type of building include a variety of materials such as wood shingles, asbestos shingles, and clay tile. Gravity loads are carried by the walls in compression, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear.",
RMS:2C2,Confined Masonry,"Confined Masonry : Buildings having walls constructed with a combination of grouted masonry units and reinforced concrete beams and columns. In constructing confined masonry, masonry wall segments are erected first, and then reinforced concrete columns and beams are cast around the wall segments, thus confining the walls. The walls may have staggered brick ends that protrude into adjacent columns for better bonding. Confinement refers to the walls themselves, not their reinforcement. This method of construction is distinctly different from reinforced concrete frame with unreinforced masonry infill where the walls are constructed after the frame is built. Floors are constructed of either wood or reinforced concrete, and the roof is typically wood joist covered with shingles or tile. Gravity loads are resisted by the walls in compression and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the walls in shear. This type of construction is not used in the U.S. but is popular in many countries of the world, particularly in Latin America.",
RMS:2C3,Confined Masonry with non-RC Slab,Confined Masonry with non-RC Slab : RMS2C3 in the Mexico Earthquake model is specifically designed for Confined Masonry with non- RC (such as wood or masonry) slab.,

RMS:3A,Cast-in-place Reinforced Concrete WITH CONCRETE ROOF DECK,Cast-in-place Reinforced Concrete WITH CONCRETE ROOF DECK,
RMS:3A1,Reinforced Concrete Moment Resisting Frame (RCMRF),"Reinforced Concrete Moment Resisting Frame (RCMRF) : Buildings having reinforced concrete columns, beams, and floor and roof slabs. All of the components are cast-in-place. Gravity loads are carried by the columns, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the rigid moment-resisting frame that is created at the intersection of the beams and columns. This is a very popular form of construction for all types of occupancies worldwide.",
RMS:3A2,RCMRF with Shear Walls,"RCMRF with Shear Walls : Buildings having the same type of column, beam, floor slab and roof slab components as those described for Construction Class 3A1, but include reinforced concrete shear walls. Gravity loads are carried by the columns (and perhaps the shear walls), and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by both the rigid moment-resisting frame action created at the beam- column joints and by the shear walls. This is sometimes referred to as a dual system because lateral forces are resisted by both the frame and the shear walls.",
RMS:3A3,RCMRF with Unreinforced Masonry Infill,"RCMRF with Unreinforced Masonry Infill : Buildings having the same type of column, beam, floor slab and roof slab components as those described for Construction Class 3A1, but include unreinforced masonry infill walls. Gravity loads are carried by the columns and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by both the rigid moment-resisting frame action created at the beam-column joints. The unreinforced masonry infill walls are included only for the purpose of enclosing space. This is a very common form of construction worldwide.",
RMS:3A4,Reinforced Concrete Shear Wall,"Reinforced Concrete Shear Wall : Buildings constructed of reinforced concrete shear walls and floor and roof slabs. A pure shear wall building does not require columns or beams for stability. However, shear wall buildings typically include columns, certainly in the interior to carry gravity loads, and sometimes on the exterior as well. Gravity loads are carried by the shear walls and columns, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the shear walls. This type of construction is common throughout the world, and is very prevalent in Chile.",
RMS:3A5,Waffle or Flat Slab,"Waffle or Flat Slab : Buildings constructed with reinforced concrete columns and waffle slabs or flat slabs. The important distinction for this type of building is that beams are not evident. From the underside of a waffle slab, they look exactly like waffles. From the underside of a flat slab, they look simply flat. Gravity loads are carried by the columns, and earthquake lateral forces are resisted by the rigid moment-resisting frame action created at the intersection of the columns and slabs. Waffle slabs were very popular throughout the world in the mid 1900s, but their demonstrated poor performance during earthquakes has diminished their use. Flat slabs have been common worldwide throughout the 20th Century, but these are no longer used in earthquake astute parts of the world.",
RMS:3A6,Steel & Reinforced Concrete (SRC) Composite Frame,"Steel & Reinforced Concrete (SRC) Composite Frame : Buildings constructed using a combination of steel shapes (I or Wide-Flange sections) that are encased in concrete to form the composite column and beam elements of the frame. Gravity loads are carried by columns, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the rigid-moment action of the frame. SRC buildings are popular in Japan, and some buildings of this type have been constructed in other countries throughout the world.",

RMS:3B1,Precast Moment Resisting Frame,"Precast Moment Resisting Frame : Buildings having reinforced concrete frame components (beams and columns) that are casted and brought to the site for assembly. Floor and roof elements are also typically made up from precast reinforced concrete components. In constructing these buildings, the precast beam and column elements, with protruding reinforcing steel, are temporarily braced in final position leaving about a one foot gap between the beam and column components. The reinforcing steel protruding from the ends of the beams and columns are attached to adjacent beam and column components using either welding or mechanical reinforcement connectors. Finally, the one foot gap between the beam and column components is filled with concrete. The floor and roof elements are attached to the frame similarly. Gravity loads are resisted by the columns, and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the rigid moment action of the frame that is created.",
RMS:3B2,Precast MRF with Shear Walls,"Precast MRF with Shear Walls : Buildings having precast reinforced concrete beam and column components, and floor and roof elements, similar to those described for Construction Class 3B1, but in addition include reinforced concrete shear walls.

In this type of building, gravity loads are carried by the columns and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the rigid moment frame action of the frame created. The URM infill walls are included only for the purpose of creating space closures.",
RMS:3B4,Tilt-up,"Tilt-up : Buildings having perimeter walls made of large single-height reinforced concrete panels that are tilted up into wall position. The wall units are then anchored to the foundation and are inter connected. The floors and roof, typically constructed of wood, are then connected to the perimeter walls. If the building has a large foot print, the building may have intermediate columns between the walls to support interior gravity loads. Gravity loads are resisted by the tilt-up walls and any intermediate columns. Lateral earthquake loads are resisted by the shear-wall action of the tilt- up walls. The tilt-up wall panels can be casted at the site, but more commonly, they are casted at a precasting plant. Tilt-up buildings are typically one story, but three story buildings of this type have been constructed. Tilt-up buildings are most commonly used for industrial occupancies, but they are used throughout the world for residential and commercial occupancies as well.",
RMS:3B5,Precast Panel Bearing Wall,"Precast Panel Bearing Wall : Buildings having walls made up from precast reinforced concrete panels that are typically one story high and 20 to 30 feet long. Floors and roof for these buildings are either precast or cast-in place reinforced concrete elements. In constructing these buildings, the precast wall elements, with protruding reinforcing steel, are temporarily braced in final position leaving about a one foot gap between the wall panels. The reinforcing steel protruding from each of the four edges of the panel are attached to the adjacent wall element, to the foundation for bottom panels, and/or to horizontal floor or roof elements using either welding or mechanical reinforcement connectors. Finally, the one foot gap between the panels is filled with concrete. Gravity loads and lateral earthquake forces are both carried by the monolithic walls created in this construction process. This type of construction has not been used in the U.S., but it is very popular in Eastern Europe, and it has been used in Latin America.",
RMS:3B6,Lift Slab,"Lift Slab : A method of concrete building construction in which the roof and floor slabs are cast, usually at ground level, and then raised into position by jacking them up along the columns.

Floor and roof diaphragms are typically composed of metal decking with concrete fill or cast-in-place concrete slabs. Exterior walls can be any of several types such as metal, precast concrete panel, or brick masonry. Gravity loads are carried by the columns, and lateral earthquake forces are carried by the rigid moment- resisting frame action created at the beam-column joints. This type of construction is somewhat common throughout the world, particularly for high-rise buildings.",

The concentric diagonal bracing typically is installed, running from a lower beam-column joint to an upper diagonally opposed beam-column joint. Floor and roof diaphragms are typically composed of metal decking with concrete fill or cast-in-place concrete slabs. Exterior walls can be any of several types such as metal, precast concrete panel, or brick masonry. Gravity loads are carried by the columns, and lateral earthquake forces are carried by the diagonal bracing. This type of construction is common throughout the world for all occupancy types and for all building heights.",
RMS:4A5,Eccentrically Braced Steel Frame,"Eccentrically Braced Steel Frame : Buildings having the same structural system characteristics as those described for Construction Class 4A4, except that the diagonal bracing is installed at a beam-column joint at one end with the other end attached to the beam above eccentric (at some distance away) from the beam-column joint above. Gravity loads are carried by the columns and lateral earthquake forces are resisted by the eccentric bracing.

RMS:5A,Manufactured/ Mobile Home without Tie- Downs,"Manufactured/ Mobile Home without Tie- Downs : Buildings that are manufactured (completely assembled in a plant), and moved to the desired site. Once sited, utilities are connected and the building is ready for use. In the mid 1900s, most mobile homes came with wheels, and the wheels were removed when the home was permanently situated. Today most of these buildings come without wheels, and the home is hauled to the desired site on a flatbed truck. These are commonly referred to as Manufactured buildings.
